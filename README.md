# AWS Interview Study Guide - Senior Engineer Level

## 📚 Overview
This comprehensive study guide is designed for senior engineer interviews at AWS and other cloud-focused companies. It covers essential data structures, algorithms, system design principles, and scalability patterns with JavaScript code examples.

## 🎯 Target Audience
- Senior Software Engineers (5+ years experience)
- Solutions Architects preparing for AWS interviews
- Engineers transitioning to cloud-focused roles

## 📖 Study Guide Structure

### 🌟 Start Here - Fundamentals
**[Understanding Complexity](./00-complexity-explained.md)** - Big O notation explained like you're five, with visual examples and AWS cost implications

### Core Data Structures
1. **[Arrays and Lists](./01-arrays-and-lists.md)** - Dynamic arrays, linked lists, and their AWS applications
2. **[Trees and Graphs](./02-trees-and-graphs.md)** - Binary trees, BST, graphs, and network topologies
3. **[Hash Maps and Sets](./03-hash-maps-and-sets.md)** - Hash tables, collision resolution, and caching strategies
4. **[Queues and Stacks](./04-queues-and-stacks.md)** - FIFO/LIFO structures, priority queues, and message systems

### Algorithms
5. **[Searching and Sorting](./05-searching-and-sorting.md)** - Binary search, sorting algorithms, and query optimization
6. **[Divide and Conquer](./06-divide-and-conquer.md)** - Recursive strategies and distributed processing
7. **[Graph Algorithms](./07-graph-algorithms.md)** - BFS vs DFS, shortest paths, and network routing

### System Design & Scalability
8. **[Scalability Patterns](./08-scalability-patterns.md)** - Horizontal scaling, redundancy, and partitioning
9. **[Caching and Performance](./09-caching-and-performance.md)** - Cache strategies, CDNs, and database optimization
10. **[Distributed Systems](./10-distributed-systems.md)** - Load balancing, queues, and consistency models

## 🔑 Key Learning Objectives
- Master runtime complexity analysis (Big O notation)
- Understand memory usage patterns and optimization
- Apply data structures to real-world AWS services
- Design scalable and fault-tolerant systems
- Optimize for both performance and cost

## 💡 Study Tips
1. **Practice Daily**: Spend 1-2 hours daily on different topics
2. **Code Everything**: Don't just read - implement each data structure
3. **Think Cloud-Native**: Always consider distributed system implications
4. **Mock Interviews**: Practice explaining your solutions out loud
5. **System Design**: Draw architecture diagrams for every solution

## 🛠️ JavaScript Environment Setup
All code examples are written in modern JavaScript (ES6+) and can be run in:
- Node.js 14+ 
- Browser console
- Online editors like CodePen or JSFiddle
