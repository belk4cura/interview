# Behavioral Questions for AWS Interviews

## Overview
Behavioral interviews assess your soft skills, problem-solving approach, and cultural fit. AWS uses the Leadership Principles as a framework for evaluation. This guide provides structured approaches and examples for common behavioral questions.

## AWS Leadership Principles

### 1. Customer Obsession
Leaders start with the customer and work backwards.

**Sample Questions:**
- "Tell me about a time you went above and beyond for a customer."
- "Describe a situation where you had to balance customer needs with business constraints."

**STAR Response Example:**
```
Situation: Customer's production system was experiencing intermittent failures
Task: Identify root cause and prevent future occurrences
Action: 
- Set up 24/7 monitoring with CloudWatch
- Analyzed logs to find pattern (memory leak during peak hours)
- Implemented auto-scaling and memory management
- Created runbook for support team
Result: 
- Zero downtime in following 6 months
- Customer saved 30% on infrastructure costs
- Became reference customer for our solution
```

### 2. Ownership
Leaders are owners. They think long term and don't sacrifice long-term value for short-term results.

**Sample Questions:**
- "Describe a time when you took on something outside your area of responsibility."
- "Tell me about a time you had to make a decision without your manager's input."

**Key Points:**
- Show initiative beyond job description
- Demonstrate long-term thinking
- Take responsibility for failures

### 3. Invent and Simplify
Leaders expect and require innovation and invention from their teams.

**Sample Questions:**
- "Tell me about a time you invented something."
- "Describe a complex system you simplified."

**Example Framework:**
```
Complex Problem → Innovation → Simplified Solution → Measurable Impact
```

### 4. Are Right, A Lot
Leaders are right a lot. They have strong judgment and good instincts.

**Sample Questions:**
- "Tell me about a time you were wrong."
- "Describe a decision you made based on data vs. intuition."

**Response Strategy:**
- Show data-driven decision making
- Acknowledge when wrong and lessons learned
- Balance analysis with timely decisions

### 5. Learn and Be Curious
Leaders are never done learning and always seek to improve themselves.

**Sample Questions:**
- "What's something you've learned recently?"
- "Tell me about a time you had to quickly learn a new technology."

### 6. Hire and Develop the Best
Leaders raise the performance bar with every hire and promotion.

**Sample Questions:**
- "Tell me about your best hire."
- "Describe how you've mentored someone."

### 7. Insist on the Highest Standards
Leaders have relentlessly high standards.

**Sample Questions:**
- "Tell me about a time you wouldn't compromise on quality."
- "Describe a time you raised the bar on your team."

### 8. Think Big
Leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results.

**Sample Questions:**
- "Tell me about your most ambitious project."
- "Describe a time you took a calculated risk."

### 9. Bias for Action
Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible.

**Sample Questions:**
- "Tell me about a time you made a quick decision with limited data."
- "Describe a situation where you moved fast and it backfired."

### 10. Frugality
Accomplish more with less.

**Sample Questions:**
- "Tell me about a time you had to work with limited resources."
- "Describe how you've reduced costs without sacrificing quality."

### 11. Earn Trust
Leaders listen attentively, speak candidly, and treat others respectfully.

**Sample Questions:**
- "Tell me about a time you had to earn someone's trust."
- "Describe a difficult conversation you had with a colleague."

### 12. Dive Deep
Leaders operate at all levels, stay connected to the details, and audit frequently.

**Sample Questions:**
- "Tell me about a time you had to dig into the details to solve a problem."
- "Describe a situation where the details mattered."

### 13. Have Backbone; Disagree and Commit
Leaders respectfully challenge decisions when they disagree.

**Sample Questions:**
- "Tell me about a time you disagreed with your manager."
- "Describe a situation where you had to support a decision you disagreed with."

### 14. Deliver Results
Leaders focus on the key inputs and deliver them with the right quality and in a timely fashion.

**Sample Questions:**
- "Tell me about a time you delivered a project under a tight deadline."
- "Describe your most challenging project and how you delivered it."

## STAR Method Framework

### Structure
- **S**ituation: Context and background
- **T**ask: Your responsibility or challenge
- **A**ction: Specific steps you took
- **R**esult: Outcome and lessons learned

### Example: System Migration to AWS

**Situation:**
"Our on-premise infrastructure was costing $50K/month and couldn't scale for Black Friday traffic. We had 3 months to migrate before peak season."

**Task:**
"As lead engineer, I needed to migrate 50+ microservices to AWS while maintaining zero downtime for our e-commerce platform processing $10M daily."

**Action:**
"I took a phased approach:
1. **Assessment Phase** (Week 1-2):
   - Cataloged all services and dependencies
   - Identified critical path services
   - Created migration priority matrix

2. **Pilot Migration** (Week 3-4):
   - Migrated non-critical service first
   - Documented issues and solutions
   - Created reusable CloudFormation templates

3. **Parallel Run** (Week 5-8):
   - Set up AWS infrastructure in parallel
   - Implemented data sync with DMS
   - Used Route 53 for gradual traffic shifting

4. **Cutover** (Week 9-12):
   - Migrated services in waves
   - Implemented rollback procedures
   - Conducted load testing with 3x expected traffic"

**Result:**
"Successfully migrated with zero downtime. Results included:
- 40% cost reduction ($30K/month savings)
- 10x scalability (handled Black Friday with 5x normal traffic)
- 50% improvement in page load times
- Team trained on AWS best practices
- Created playbook used for 3 subsequent migrations"
